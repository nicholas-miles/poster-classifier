"Always scare Daniel-san, Miyagi hate fighting." "Miyagi hate fighting." - Line? - "Yeah, but you like karate." Right, right, yeah, but, y you like karate though. So? - Line. - Chang, the audition's at 3.00. Maybe I shouldn't go, you know, maybe I'm a bad actor. Being good is a fraction of acting. It takes discipline and confidence. Discipline, confidence. Okay from the top. "Always scare Daniel-san. Miyagi hate fighting." Line. I heard Karate Kid quotes. Chang is auditioning for the stage adaptation of Karate Kid downtown. Yeah, and it's for the part of Daniel LaRusso. - You got a problem with that, racist? - No, you're acting now? - Yeah, you got a problem with that? - I'm clear. They took my snake, and they turned it into a plumber. They made the eggs, into barrels. The pine tree they made into a gorilla, but I recognized my design. Donkey Kong my ass. That's construction snake. - I don't practice law anymore. - But, we have a case, right? - Isn't everyone you'd be suing dead? - That's not cool, man. - Why would a tree throw eggs at a snake? - Why would a plumber be fighting a monkey? I don't know, I don't know. The Wi-Fi's still broken. - What happened to good morning? - It's a bad morning, no Wi-Fi. Yeah, we really need Wi-Fi. Okay, let's not get carried away. We need oxygen. We have oxygen, we need Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi. Okay, enough, right? Look what I'm doing, look. Fix, Wi-Fi. Mm-hm, okay, boom and boom. All right. I, I'm trying to find the IT lady. My emails to her get bounced back to me in Aramaic, and when I call, I hear an undulating high-pitched whistle that makes my nose bleed. Well, sounds like a bad IT lady, right? Frankie, hire a new IT lady. I'm pretty handy with technology. I'm assuming it's still the same, smaller holes, more bytes. - Now what are we up to now, mega? - Tera. Tera. They did it, those bastards. They finally did it. Frankie, hire Elroy. Elroy, you're the IT lady. - Can I be his assistant? - Not for money. - Can I be his friend? - Elroy, Abed is your friend. Now the real reason I came by, I'm dying. Not really, but imagine how bad you feel for complaining about the Wi-Fi. Here's the real reason. Too short? It is too short? It's not too short? You people are no help. School board come in. School board, you're surrounded. If this is about the bonfire, we'll put it out when the weather breaks. We come in peace. We've had our ups and downs, but as of right now. We love this school, and love what you're doing with it. What? Why? What would you think about moving up? Well. Joining us on the board? Me? I would love to be on the school board. - Awesome. - Awesome. One, one more thing. You're gay, right? I mean, like openly gay. I'm not openly anything, and gay doesn't begin to cover it. No, no. Oh, I get it. This is about the uproar over you guys cancelling the pride parade, for a school board parade. Those guys get to dress fancy all year. - No, no. - We have one day! No, this isn't about that. This is about adding a new face to the board. But, if that new face happened to be openly gay, it would be because we're so tolerant. And always were. But, that's for us to deal with. The question you have to ask is, am I openly gay? Because, if you are that gayness could be a rocket, thrusting you to new gay heights. And if you're not. Well, there's a lot of gay guys out there. I assume that's the selling point of the lifestyle. You know, I, I, I never thought about it that way. Well, I have. Cutting women out of sex, it's genius. Gay dean. Gay dean. Gay dean. Gay dean. I'm begging you to be a gay dean of the school board. This should lead to the router. Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back back. Wh, wh, what's going on? There's a birds nest in there, with babies in it. The mother must have built it there because of the heat. Same reason my mom took my half brother to Arizona. That's probably why the Wi-Fi's down, we'll have to move it. If you move them the mother won't come back. Those birds aren't the new IT lady, I am. I'll move it carefully. The mother won't come back. Kid, animals have been murdering each other for 3 billion years. Birds have had their 15 million in the spotlight. The same as lizards and plants and they all just use it to murder, eat, screw and not invent Wi-Fi. Now we may end up saving this world, or blowing it to hell or making a new one. But we can't do any of it while scheduling our evolution around the needs of the least lucky birds. What are you, a demon? Did Clive Barker write you? Anyone who finds that nest, will come to the same decision. And you don't have to get mean. Mean? You just did a baby bird murder monologue. Maybe they're close to leaving the nest, until then can't you just stall by doing what real IT people do? - What's that? - Exactly. I've got one year to make it all work, and that's what I'm gonna do, make it work, all of it. This place is intimidating. You're gonna do great. Next up, Ben Chang, for the role of Daniel LaRusso. Thank you. Daniel-san, why you want learn karate? - Hang on a second. - Sorry, I can do better. Zip it. Who are you? Oh, I'm Annie, a friend of Chang's. You mind coming up here and reading with your friend? Okay, if it helps. - "Daniel-san, what you want?" - Okay, no, sorry, no. You read Daniel-san. You read Miyagi. We'll do scene seven, Miyagi's office. - Are you the repairman? - Aye. - The faucet's really leaky there. - Aye. - When you gonna fix it? - After. - After what? - After after. Tell everyone else to go home. We got the parts! Hear, hear. Parts plural? Well yeah, Annie got my part and I got the Asian part. Chang Stop! We were cast as Mr. Miyagi and the Karate Kid, because we're a good team! We're a team, because one of us is so talented she got cast outside her gender and the other one, got cast because of eye shape. I am not letting you sabotage yourself like this. Let's say you're right. And like Sidney Poitier or Meg Ryan before you, you were cast for race. It's what the actor does with the role they get, that matters. - All right? - You're right. All right, IT lady. How goes it? - I found your problem. - And? I'll need a little time to fix it. Wow, need time to fix it? You sound just like you work in IT. I've got some interesting news, the school board, offered me a position. Great. Cool. Well I got a part in a play and we were sort of talking about that, so read the room Pelton. - Are you gonna take the job? - I don't know, there's a catch. Jeffrey, Frankie, could I see you in my office please? They want you to be a token homosexual? It's a form of progress, 30 years ago, the most power an openly gay could achieve was a center square. - But I'm not just gay. - What does that mean? If coming out is a magic show, and gayness is the rabbit out of the hat, I'm one of those never-ending handkerchiefs. The sad truth, Craig? Anything other than straight, is plenty gay for a school board. The most important point is, are you prepared to make your sexuality, which is nobody's business, an aspect of your role in society? I know I'm not, so I don't. No? When a person becomes symbolic they gain symbolic power, at the price of independent power. Yep. That's an excellent point. It could be good for Greendale, for one of our own to be on the school board. I mean the fact that you'd be leaving a few items off your list of your turn-ons, I mean, the goal in politics, isn't transparency, it's winning. - That's why the politicians always win. - They do always win, don't they? But now I get a chance to win. I could change the system from the inside out. And all I have to do is pare down my sexuality to simple gayness, which is heavily in the mix. There you go. Get ready, America. Dean Pelton is coming out as approximately two-sevenths of what he is. Come on. Don't leave me hanging. There we go. I am so curious. - Oh. - Intellectually. All right. This is a pretty basic scene. No real subtext. Let's just get it up on its feet. There's no wrong answers. Okay? Great. Go. Hey, come fix faucet. Oh, Karate, learn from book? Yeah. And a few classes back at the Y in Jersey where I'm from. What happened I? Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. I guess there are wrong answers. Quick adjustment, Ben. - Yeah? - Act better. Act better. Thanks. Annie, you're doing great. Keep doing what you're doing. Oh. - Can I ask about by motiv - Keep me from puking is your motivation. Stop making me want to quit the theater and kill myself. Go. After "what happened I. Oh. Okay. Hey. I fell off my bike. Hm. Lucky no hurt hand. Okay. Can I see this tool box? Great. This is good. Got it. I got distracted cuz the tools were doing a better job than you. What happened I? Say it. What happened I. Liar. Stop lying to me. Say it. - What happened I. - What happened actor? You crying? You cry when I tell you to cry. So reabsorb that disgusting droplet of salt and bad choices back into your doughy body. And then call your mother to see if you can be reabsorbed back into her doughy body or so help me God, I will take that tear, I will freeze it, and I will stab you in the eye with it, you waste of a soul-shaped hole forgotten by God. Okay. What should I Annie, don't change a thing, you're perfect. Unless you want to. Okay. All right I'm Rich Countee, this is my man Carl. We work on the school board. - Yeah, we do. - We have some exciting news for you. Your own dean, Craig Pelton, has been selected to join the board of Colorado Community Colleges, and I'll just, go, go ahead Dean. Guys. Talk. Okay. Hello Greendale. As you know, this is something I wanted for a very long time and I wanted to thank all of the people at Greendale that helped me achieve this and my partner, Domingo. - Very proud of my Craig. - Oh, that's, but, oh, oh. And now let's open it up to some questions. - Dean. - Dean. As a gay dean, what is your opinion about the recent controversy surrounding the cancelled Pride Parade, and do you think you were selected to join the board because of your sexual preference? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I would just like to say that we are very proud to have Mr. Pelton on the board, whatever his lifestyle may be. Which happens to be gay! Which is great, but irrelevant! Hey, it gets better! Oh good. We're so happy. - I feel like scum. - Gay people are scum? Hey, don't play that card with me young man. I make gayness look like Mormonism. I don't like being this dishonest. Dean, I want to say thanks for doing this. I never knew. I mean, people talked, but Sure, well, it really doesn't have anything to do with my work. Yeah, but it's helpful, to me. You know, and to a lot of us, so. Thank you. Hm. Confine yourself to your role, Domingo. And lose the attitude. Hare krishna. Krishna krishna. Oh, Daniel-san, you much-a humor. Hm, okay. Let's stop there. I'm not gonna hit you. And it's not because it's illegal, and it's certainly not because I'm afraid you know karate because there is nothing about your performance that is believable. See, we only hit things, that effect us. I don't hit water, or old mayonnaise. Or the air after a fart has dissipated. And I'm not hitting you. You are the worst actor I've ever directed and I've directed both Wahlbergs! From the top! Danny does a bit with the floor sanders, Miyagi is amused, and Kenny gets me another god damned cup of coffee with six Splendas in it! Hare Krishna. He's so mean to Chang. I don't know what to do. You could just drop out of the play. Well, you know I could. Or Chang could. I mean, the director is not being mean to me. But you talked Chang into auditioning and then you got his part and now he's suffering. - You're right, I should threaten to quit. - Or just quit. Well, if I threaten to quit maybe that will be enough for him to stop abusing Chang. I was kind of born to act, Britta. When I do it, I can feel it pleasing the universe. - That's dramatic. - See? The internet says that if they're sparrows they'll be flying in less than 12 days. If they're albatrosses, we're in trouble. Albatrosses have a 270 day fledgling period. Thanks for guarding the nest with me. Uh-oh. This is what you do when you're working? Must be nice. All right, look. There's a bird's nest in the router. Now if you want to fire me, fire me. Either way, until those birds are gone nobody gets any closer. Well of course not. If you move them the mother won't come back. Keep up the good work. Show me wax on. This is the worst acting I've ever seen in my life. Show me wax, off. The ghost of your father just turned his back on you. Your ancestors are clawing their way deeper into the Earth to get away from you, you make me embarrassed to have thumbs, I can see air quotes around you. Show me, paint fence. Knock, knock, knock, anybody home? Oh look, there's nobody here, oh it's so dusty, it's almost like nobody's been here in years. There's a note. "Never let me act." Mr. Lundergard, I'm sorry, but I cannot stand by while you do this. - That's fine, you can go. - I'm not bluffing. You can't make an actor more talented by yelling at them. And if you don't stop, your lead character is going to walk. Lead? You play Danny LaRusso. Well I'm the Karate Kid. The Karate Kid is about Kesuke Miyagi, an immigrant who fought against his own people in World War II, while his wife lost a child in an internment camp. Noriyuki Morita was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Ralph Macchio? Showed up. I cast you because your measurements allow me to use the same wardrobe as last year. I cast Ben because he has the sadness and talent that could make this show great. If I have to physically drill into his chest and suck it out with a straw! So you can take a flying kick and a rolling donut! You're fired. But I'm talented, too, right? What? No. Really? Really? Oh my God! You're like doing a terrible Vinnie Barbarino up here. But, like, I know you're not capable of anything better, so, that's why I've been so nice to you. Take care Annie. Yikes, right? What a diva. - Thanks for sticking up for me. - No problem? From now on, she's dead to us. Hey gay Dean, we got a problem here. You ring the local papers? You've shut down the campus Wi-Fi until a nest of baby birds can grow? That's a little too gay. I didn't do it because I'm gay. Wait, I'm not gay. Oh, that did not just get said to us. You are gay. You are openly gay and we love it. But now we are dealing with more flak from conservatives for appointing you than we ever did from gays for not having one of you. Yeah, and the gays aren't coming to your side. You know why? Because the whole point is to get a job by being gay and then to do as good of job as the normals. That's what the gays want. They don't want a gay dean who acts like a weird gay monster. - I'm not a gay dean. - Whoa, not Cool, man. Don't bring us into your web of lies. Well, now what do you want me to do? Figure it out, gay dean. Figure it out. - Hey, Domingo. - Hey, what's up? Guys, the school needs Wi-Fi, and my job is to run the school. The school doesn't need baby birds. - The nest needs to be moved. - You are not crossing this line. - I'm taping this. This is on video. - Guys This is two white security guards versus one unarmed black man and two baby birds. Your move. Stand down. Stand down. No security, no weapons. Just one unarmed black man versus one unarmed, openly gay dean. Now move that nest, please. Just a hair back Domingo, it's like you're breathing for me. I have called this press conference because I have been less than honest with the public. You know me as the openly gay dean of Greendale Community College, but that doesn't even begin to describe what I really am. I belong to one of the most marginalized and least openly honest groups in America. I am a politician. Now what does that mean? Are politicians like you? Well we look like you, but we will say and do whatever we have to in order to acquire and keep our jobs. It means nothing I say and very few of the things I think can be trusted. I am tired of being in this particular closet so I am coming out now. I only hope that you can accept an openly political person on your board. If not, I understand. Thank you. It's just faster if I get to my office this way. We don't need any pictures of this. I can't believe the Dean got kicked off the school board just for admitting he's political. Yeah. Some groups take longer than others to gain acceptance. We like our politicians in the closet because we're afraid, deep down, we're all a little political. - Any of you guys smell a bird murderer? - I came here to apologize. Well, I hope your apology comes with a beak and hollow bones and a special magnet in its head it uses to migrate. - You skipped wings. - Insects have wings. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Abed. I lost myself in a role. It won't happen again. Two of them died. There's one left. He's hanging on, but I'm worried he's turning into a symbol of my own innocence. - Isn't Chang's play tonight? - If any of you go, you're supporting abuse. Oh, dial it back, Annie. Well, I'm definitely in. It'll be interesting to see how his fake crying is different from his real crying. Well I'm a big fan of the performing arts, but I'll go to Chang's play anyway. Karate Kid adaptation? Karate Kid adaptation? Okay. I might. I'm catching up. Directors have a saying. Actors are worthless, empty-headed homunculi, but the right one, in the right role can change the world. Hm, I have found the right one. He's found the right role, and tonight, your world changes. You're welcome. - He replaced me with Annie Kim. - Shh. Hee-ah! Ow. Sorry. You okay? You must be the new people in apartment 20. What was that? Karate? Yeah, you know? Hey, me and some of my friends are gonna have a party at the beach later. You should come. - Hey! Are you the repair man? - Aye. - Faucet's really leaking there. - Aye. - When are you gonna fix it? - After. - After what? - After, after. Come ask, leave boy alone to train. You got a lot of nerve, old man. But I like that. I like that. - Name a place. - Tournament. Yes, sir. Regret to inform wife, sir. Complication at birth, sir. No doctor, it can't. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Please forgive me. - Shh. No need fight anymore, you proved point. What? That I could take a beating? Every time I see those guys, they'll know they got the best of me. Close eye. Get up, Daniel. Get up! Yeah, woo woo! - You all right, LaRusso? - Yeah, you missed my head. We did it, Mister Miyagi. We did it. - I'm speechless. - I forgot Chang was up there. Me, too. It's such a relief to be able to support him out of something other than fear. I guess all that suffering Chang endured paid off. It's not what the play suggests, but you have to wonder if it wouldn't have been better for Daniel to get beat up even more. I am at a total loss about what lesson to learn from any of this. Maybe that's the lesson. Hm. - I lost a button. - Maybe we all lost a button. Hey, hey guys! Thank you so much. - Hey, thank you for making me do this. - You're welcome. Congratulations. - I'm jealous. - No, no, don't be. Believe me, I sit in my dressing room and all I dream about is a white picket fence and a dog. I don't have those either. Chang, let's go. I guess all the actors go to some sort of actor bar together. So, I'll see you guys at school. Bye. Hey, I know this great bar for people that don't hate themselves. What do you say? - My lady. - My lord. We are gathered here today to celebrate the release of this bird into these skies. That its now fully formed wings may find purchase upon the four winds. If anyone would like to say something, now's the time. Oh, I'll always remember how you kept me from getting email for a week. And that chirp you do when you want more bread. Yeah, that one. And now everyone, please put on your cat masks and finger wings. With these cat masks, we remind you that this place can no longer be your home, but with the fluttering of these wings, we symbolically join your flight into the natural world. Wings everyone. Okay. You can go now. Yeah. Off you go. Time to go, little bird, that's just the way it is. Whee! Aw. - Then it's done. - You did the right thing, Abed. Thanks to you, that bird has his whole bird life ahead of him, to fly, meet lady birds, even start a bird family. You made a difference. Aw. Abed.
